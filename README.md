# Vue Mongo Client Starter

##### What it includes? 
Nothing. It's a starter pack (duh!)
##### Actually it includes:
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - Vee Validate (for input validation)
  - Vuex and Vue router ( comes with Vue CLI, but still... )

### Features:
  This repository includes a simple CRUD application with user sign in and sign up.
  It uses JSON web token and stores it in the Local storage. 
  It doesn't have that much styling to keep it really simple.


### How to use 
Clone the repository, run `npm install` then run `npm run serve`.
If everything is installed correctly and the vue_mongo_api is running, the http://localhost:8080 should display the application.
